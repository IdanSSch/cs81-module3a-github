I've been using Git for about 5 years now; I know everything from force pushing to ignoring files.

Git's command line is... not great. Luckily, WebStorm's UI is more than usable for what I want.

(For the record, I am on an alt account on GitHub, as my main account is connected to some important projects.)
Git is massively useful for projects with more than 20 collaborators, as I have experienced in the past.
